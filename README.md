# Code_Clan
===========
A social network web app for bloggers. (Not completed)

Code_Clan was initially a treehouse social network web app project which I decided to pivot into a web app geared towards linking bloggers

Built with Python Flask Framework, Sqlite database and Peewee ORM

Additional packages include:
Flask-bcrypt for password hashing, 
Flask-login, a login manager package.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding features, fixing bugs etc since its no where near complete. 

The sky is the limit!
