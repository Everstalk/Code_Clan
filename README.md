# Code_Clan

A social network web app for bloggers. (Not completed).
--------------------------------------
Code_Clan was initially a treehouse social network web app project which I decided to pivot into an app geared towards linking bloggers.

Built with Python Flask Framework, Sqlite database and Peewee ORM.

Flask-bcrypt for password hashing, 
Flask-login, a login manager package.
